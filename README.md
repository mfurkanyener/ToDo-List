# To-Do List App

A simple and elegant To-Do List application built with React. This project allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It’s a great starter project for learning React fundamentals such as state management, component structure, and basic styling.

## Features

### Add Tasks: 
Users can add new tasks via an input field.
### Complete Tasks: 
A simple toggle functionality lets users mark tasks as completed or revert them back to “incomplete.”
### Delete Tasks: 
Easily remove any unwanted tasks from the list.
### Responsive Design: 
Basic styling and layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Usage
 1. Type a task name in the input field.
 2. Clik 'Add' to add the task to the list.
 3. Click "✔" on a task to mark it as completed (it will appear with a line-though).
 4. Click "❌" to remove a task from the list.

## Roadmap / Possible Enhancements
Local Storage Integration: Save tasks so they persist after page reloads.

Edit Tasks: Allow users to edit task descriptions.

Priority or Categorization: Let users assign priority levels or categories to tasks.

Search / Filter: Provide a search bar or filtering options (completed/incomplete).
